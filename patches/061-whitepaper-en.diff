+# ðŸ”¥ Inferno Whitepaper (English Version)
+
+## Vision & Goal
+Inferno ($IFR) is a **deflationary multichain token** designed to reduce supply continuously through burn mechanisms while ensuring transparent governance and adoption across chains.
+
+## Tokenomics
+- **Total Supply:** 1 billion IFR  
+- **Fees:**  
+  - SenderBurn: 2.0 %  
+  - RecipientBurn: 0.5 %  
+  - PoolFee: 1.0 %  
+- **FeeExempt mechanism** for specific contracts (Presale, Vesting, Treasury).
+
+## Core Components
+### Token Core
+ERC20-based with custom burn logic and fee exemptions.
+
+### Presale
+- Fixed price sale  
+- ETH â†’ IFR swap (Treasury receives ETH directly)  
+- FeeExempt  
+
+### Vesting
+- Linear release with cliff  
+- Protects investors and team allocations from immediate dumping  
+- Guardian (pause/unpause)  
+
+### BurnReserve
+- Holds tokens that are later permanently burned  
+- Supports long-term deflationary mechanics  
+
+### Buyback Vault
+- Manually triggered by Governance  
+- Buys back IFR using ETH  
+- Configurable split between BurnReserve and Treasury  
+- Slippage protection & cooldown  
+
+### Governance
+- Guardian Multi-Sig for initial control  
+- Timelock mechanism  
+- Transition to DAO governance planned  
+
+## Planned Extensions
+### DiscountMinter (ADR-101)
+- Cross-chain purchases with Kaspa (KAS)  
+- Up to 50 % discount  
+- Bonus IFR locked/vested to prevent dumping  
+- Relayer quorum + Oracle TWAP for security  
+
+### HoldScore (ADR-102)
+- Wallets that hold IFR longer pay reduced burn fees  
+- Up to 50 % fee reduction after 180 days  
+- Reset on outgoing transfer (prevents abuse)  
+
+## Roadmap
+1. Bootstrap â†’ Core Modules (Token, Presale, Vesting, Buyback)  
+2. Governance Setup (Guardian, Timelock, DAO transition)  
+3. Extensions (DiscountMinter, HoldScore)  
+4. Multichain expansion (Kasplex L2, bridges)
